# JapaneseEditorialDataset
A Japanese editorial data set on restart of nuclear power plants in Japan

The data set consists editorials, which can all be searched from http://shasetsu.seesaa.net/, a Japanese editorial summrization site.

Due to the copyright issue, the original data cannot be included for direct download; 
instead, we show the meta data of the involved editorials (including the name of newspaper, publication date and title), with which users can easily find the data from the site.
